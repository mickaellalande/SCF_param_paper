## Abstract
In this study, we focus on the influence of topography in 5 snow cover fraction (SCF) parameterizations. We first evaluate the SCF parameterizations with respect to the High Mountain Asia Snow Reanalysis (HMASR). Then, we implement them in the ORCHIDEE land surface model (LSM) of the Institut Pierre Simon Laplace (IPSL) general circulation model (GCM) and address their performance in global land-atmosphere coupled simulations. HMASR reveals that the SCF evolution with respect to snow depth (SD) strongly differs between flat and mountainous areas, leading to large snow cover overestimations in parameterizations not taking into account a dependency on the topography. Furthermore, the HMASR SCF–SD relationship follows a hysteresis with a rapid snow cover increase during accumulation and a slower retreat of patchy snow occurring during ablation periods, discarding parameterizations not considering this effect. The application in global simulations shows contrasting results depending on the location, especially because the snow biases are also explained by several other processes. Nevertheless, the snow cover overestimation in mountain areas is reduced on average by about 5 to 10 % in the experiments considering a dependency on the subgrid topography in their SCF parameterizations compared to the other ones. However, a persisting snow cover overestimation remains in HMA, and a SCF underestimation in several other regions (e.g., the Rockies mountains). The reduction of the snow cover biases in HMA by taking into account the subgrid topography allows to reduce the surface cold bias from -1.8 °C to about -1 °C. Further calibration should be performed over other regions and with multiple datasets to improve the SCF parameterization skills. Assessing SCF parameterizations is tenuous as it requires proper simulated snowfall and snowpack evolution, whose observations are currently very limited and uncertain in mountainous regions.
